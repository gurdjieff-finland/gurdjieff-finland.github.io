Today we are still restricted in our outer lives because of the dangers of the 
Corona Virus. But in recent times we have had endless opportunities for outer 
activities and endless new technologies for finding and sharing information.

**But sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing**, and it is 
not necessarily more of the same kind of things but rather something in the inner 
life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner life that is on a different level 
from most of modern life, **a search for real self and the meaning of our life 
here on the earth?** These and other related questions may be explored in an 
exchange where people can share their questions with each other.

Since 2002, groups in Helsinki and other cities in Finland have put the approach 
of G. I. Gurdjieff into practice. Groups have been established at times in Helsinki, 
Turku, Jyväskylä, Tampere, Joensuu and Kouvola, and most are still active. 
Other cities are also being considered for new groups.

**Our groups are the only groups in Finland that are recognized as part of the
main lineage from Gurdjieff**, with links to the key groups in Europe (London and
Paris), North America (New York, San Francisco and Washington) and Latin
America. The first group was established in Helsinki in January 2002 by Bob Reinstein, whose teacher Hugh Ripman was sent by Gurdjieff to establish a group in Washington in 1949. Ripman passed the Gurdjieff influence to Reinstein in 1979. Related groups in Finland are all based on the Gurdjieff-Ripman approach.

If you are interested in such a practical approach, you may be able to join
existing groups or be involved in forming a new group in a community where you
do not already have one.

## A new group

Our newest group is open for joining. The group meets for one hour per week over Zoom, and occasionally face-to-face as circumstances so permit.

The groups supported by the Society work on the premise of inner development becoming tangible in one's life. We study the ideas put forth by Gurdjieff and his students, but with the emphasis on evaluating their usefulness in practice. The groups offer a chance to reflect one's understanding and experiences with others similarly engaged in the inner work.
