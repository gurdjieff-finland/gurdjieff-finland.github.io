Since 2001, groups in Helsinki and other cities in Finland have been trying to
put the approach of G. I. Gurdjieff into practice. Groups have been established
at times in Helsinki, Turku, Jyväskylä, Tampere, Joensuu and Kouvola, and most
are still active. Other cities are also being considered for new groups.

Our groups are the only groups in Finland that are recognized as part of the
main lineage from Gurdjieff, with links to the key groups in Europe (London and
Paris), North America (New York, San Francisco and Washington) and Latin
America.  The groups in Finland were established by an American whose teacher
was sent by Gurdjieff to form the Washington  group.

If you are interested in such a practical approach, you may be able to join
existing groups or be involved in forming a new group in a community where you
do not already have one.
