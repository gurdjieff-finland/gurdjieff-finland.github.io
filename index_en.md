Today we are still restricted in our outer lives because of the dangers of the 
Corona Virus. But in recent times we have had endless opportunities for outer 
activities and endless new technologies for finding and sharing information.

**But sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing**, and it is 
not necessarily more of the same kind of things but rather something in the inner 
life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner life that is on a different level 
from most of modern life, **a search for real self and the meaning of our life 
here on the earth?** These and other related questions may be explored in an 
exchange where people can share their questions with each other.

Since 2002, groups in Helsinki and other cities in Finland have put the approach 
of G. I. Gurdjieff into practice. Groups have been established at times in Helsinki, 
Turku, Jyväskylä, Tampere, Joensuu and Kouvola, and most are still active. 
Other cities are also being considered for new groups.

**Our groups are the only groups in Finland that are recognized as part of the
main lineage from Gurdjieff**, with links to the key groups in Europe (London and
Paris), North America (New York, San Francisco and Washington) and Latin
America. The first group was established in Helsinki in January 2002 by Bob Reinstein, whose teacher Hugh Ripman was sent by Gurdjieff to establish a group in Washington in 1949. Ripman passed the Gurdjieff influence to Reinstein in 1979. Related groups in Finland are all based on the Gurdjieff-Ripman approach.

If you are interested in such a practical approach, you may be able to join
existing groups or be involved in forming a new group in a community where you
do not already have one.

## Next public exchange on October 11, 2023 in Helsinki

Welcome to an open discussion about the deeper possibilities of life, about what is missing! Bob Reinstein gives a brief introduction to the teachings of the mystic G.I. Gurdjieff and facilitates the discussion. The intro and discussion are mainly in English.

Bob has held discussions in Rikhardinkatu Library for over a decade and a book based on them was published in 2013 entitled Notes on Becoming.

Bob Reinstein has worked in the US Foreign Office as a vice minister with environmental, health and natural resources as his responsibility and been the main US negotiator in a UN general agreement on climate change. He has over 40 years of experience in science, economy, energy policies, trade politics, diplomacy and in applying Gurdjieff’s teachings in life. Bob is also a published poet and his paintings have been exhibited in the US and Canada (an example of which is on the left in the picture above).

Welcome to the discussion at the **Rikhardinkatu library on October 11 at 18:00**. The event lasts for an hour and will be held in the meeting room Ture, on the 1st floor of the library.
