**Sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing**, and it is not necessarily more of the 
same kind of things but rather something in the inner life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner 
life that is on a different level from most of modern life, a search for real self and the meaning of our 
life here on the earth? These and other related questions may be explored in an open exchange where people 
can share their questions with each other.
