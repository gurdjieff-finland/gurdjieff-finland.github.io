**Sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing**, and it is not necessarily more of the 
same kind of things but rather something in the inner life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner 
life that is on a different level from most of modern life, a search for real self and the meaning of our 
life here on the earth? These and other related questions may be explored in an open exchange where people 
can share their questions with each other.

## Upcoming Meetings

### Public exchange 2023, June 14: *online*

What is missing?

...other than more of the small kinds of things that already fill our lives? Who is my real self, behind the mask of all the roles I play in life? What possibilities may exist beyond the ordinary things of life, and why are they only possibilities? What tools might exist for exploring these possibilities? Real questions such as these may find a response that resonates with the question and facilitates a further exploration and leads to a deeper question.
