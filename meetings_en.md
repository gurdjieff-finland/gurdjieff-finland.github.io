**Sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing**, and it is not necessarily more of the 
same kind of things but rather something in the inner life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner 
life that is on a different level from most of modern life, a search for real self and the meaning of our 
life here on the earth? These and other related questions may be explored in an open exchange where people 
can share their questions with each other.

Welcome to an open discussion about the deeper possibilities of life, about what is missing! Bob Reinstein gives a brief introduction to the teachings of the mystic G.I. Gurdjieff and facilitates the discussion. The intro and discussion are mainly in English.

Bob has held discussions in Rikhardinkatu Library for over a decade and a book based on them was published in 2013 entitled Notes on Becoming.

Bob Reinstein has worked in the US Foreign Office as a vice minister with environmental, health and natural resources as his responsibility and been the main US negotiator in a UN general agreement on climate change. He has over 40 years of experience in science, economy, energy policies, trade politics, diplomacy and in applying Gurdjieff’s teachings in life. Bob is also a published poet and his paintings have been exhibited in the US and Canada (an example of which is on the left in the picture above).

Welcome to the discussion at the **Rikhardinkatu library on October 11 at 18:00**. The event lasts for an hour and will be held in the meeting room Ture, on the 1st floor of the library.
