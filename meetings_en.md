## Future Meetings 2020: 

* Wednesday 21.10.2020 at 18:00-19:00: WHAT’S MISSING? -open discussion in Zoom for all of Finland"

Today we are rather restricted in our outer lives because of the dangers of the Corona Virus. 
But in recent times we have had endless opportunities for outer activities and endless new technologies 
for finding and sharing information.

But sometimes there has been a feeling that something is missing, and it is not necessarily more of the 
same kind of things but rather something in the inner life. Are there possibilities for a deeper inner 
life that is on a different level from most of modern life, a search for real self and the meaning of our 
life here on the earth? These and other related questions will be explored in an open exchange where people 
can share their questions with each other.

Facilitator: Bob Reinstein, student of Gurdjieff’s ideas for more than 45 years, has led groups on three 
different continents. Individual searcher for inner meaning since 1958. Teacher was Hugh Ripman, who was 
sent to Washington by Gurdjieff in 1949 to start a group. 

Sponsor: Gurdjieff Society of Finland (Suomen Gurdjieff-Seura ry), which is the only organization in Finland 
recognized as part of the main lineage directly connected to Gurdjieff’s teachings.

The link for the meeting and password will be sent a few days before the event to those who indicate 
by email (to gurdjieffsocietyfinland@gmail.com) that they wish to participate. Details about our groups can also 
be found there. We currently have active groups in Helsinki, Turku, Tampere and Jyväskylä, and have contacts in
other areas of southern and central Finland as well.
